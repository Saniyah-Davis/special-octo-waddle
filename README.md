Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.

We are interested in what challenges you encountered in coding and if you found a way to overcome them or go around them.

We understand that it may not be possible to complete your original vision;  we are interested in how you responded in the face of adversity.  We are interested in the journey, not the destination.
